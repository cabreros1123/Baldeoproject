    <h4>To most people, the military is all about the “tooth”—the warfighters and weaponry they see on the nightly news. The tooth, however, cannot succeed without the “tail”—the complex, costly chain of goods, services, and facilities that sustains combatants, support personnel, and military families. Both face heavy budget pressures and are undergoing institutionwide transformation. But it is in the tail that most companies will find their prospects. By understanding the logic of military transformation, executives can identify and create business opportunities. By using a simple framework, they can develop strategies for capturing part of this huge, distinctive market. And by mastering certain principles, they can build profitable long-term relationships.</h4>
